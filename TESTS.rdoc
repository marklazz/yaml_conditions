Before running the tests, you must create a user called yaml_conditions (with no password) for mysql (and/or postgresql).

Then to run the suite you should be able to do:

rake spec (which will run both suites for mysql and postgres)

Or run them individually:

rake mysql:spec

rake postgres:spec

Enjoy!
